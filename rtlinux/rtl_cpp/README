This examples illustrates use of C++ in RTLinux programs.
You need to be at the console to see the output from insmod app.o.

To use C++ in RTLinux modules, you need to:

- insert rtl_cpp.o support module.

- #include rtl_cpp.h in your RT-program

- if you have statically allocated objects that
need initializing, call __do_global_ctors_aux() in init_module
and __do_global_dtors_aux() in cleanup_module (see hello.o)

- link your module with crtbegin.o and crtend.o; the
order is important (see Makefile)

- the rtl.mk file provides needed CXXFLAGS

Try inserting app.o module as an example.
