Creating new project:

For example, if you would like to create project with name "foo"
located in subdirectory foo of your home type:

   tmp]# mkplc.sh --create fooo --target-dir ~/foo

If your project consist from source file foo.plc, you must add it
to makefile, so edit file ~/foo/Makefile. Find this line in original
Makefile:

# FILES=deps/filename.plc

and change it to:

FILE=deps/foo.plc

Now create source file foo.plc with PLC program in instruction list.
When you would like compile it, simple type:

   foo]# make

In subdirectory sources you can find file named plc_foo.o, which
represents Software PLC as kernel module. If you have already started
RT-Linux modules and selected Software PLC drivers, you can start
software PLC by typing:

   foo]# make start

If you want stop PLC, type:

   foo]# make stop
