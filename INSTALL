Software PLC for RT-Linux install instructions:
===============================================

 1. Install RT-Linux for your kernel. See instructions on RT-Linux web site
    (http://www.fsmlabs.com)

 2. Download latest sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/softwareplc

 3. Unpack sources into work directory:
         ]# tar xzf SoftwarePLC-x.yy.tgz

 4. Change current directory to sources:
         ]# cd SoftwarePLC-x.yy

 5. Run configuration script:
         ]# ./configure
    
    This generates Makefiles for all modules contained in project

 6. Compile program:
	 ]# make dep
	 ]# make

 7. Install software:
	 ]# make install

 8. For instructions about creating PLC see README or sample projects
    in plc subdirectory
